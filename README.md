# EEG-Dataset
This dataset contains Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from a subject for more than four months everyday (some days are missing). The data can be used to analyze the changes in EEG signals through time (permanency).

# Dataset Description
Data Type: Raw EEG.<br />
EEG Sensor: Neurosky MindWave.<br />
Channel: Single electrode on forehead (close to F<sub>PZ</sub>).<br />
Smapling Rate: 512Hz.<br />
Mental Task: Rest state (sitting on chair with open and closed eyes).<br />
Duration: More than <b>two minutes</b> upto about three minutes for each file.<br />
Time of Day: Random (usually around 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.).<br />
Total Number of Days: 127.<br />
File Name Format: 'mm-dd-yyyy.csv'.
